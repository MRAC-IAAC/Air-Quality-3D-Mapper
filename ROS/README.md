# ROS
In this folder, you will find a couple of folders that introduce the kind of packages you will need to install specifically for using Turtlebot 2 and the LDS-01 Lidar as well as a couple of updated launch files in order to complete gmapping and AMCL. The **Packages Needed** folder contains 3 packages that all include **README.md** files that should be looked into before proceeding with anything else. We used ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04 on a virtual machine which we have installed on both a mac and windows.
